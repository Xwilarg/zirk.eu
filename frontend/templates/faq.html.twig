    <div class="button container question" id="framework">What is this website made with?</div>
    <div class="container is-hidden answer" id="answer-framework">
        This website was made using <a href="https://twig.symfony.com/" target="_blank">Twig</a> for the structure and <a href="https://bulma.io/" target="_blank">Bulma</a> for the styling<br>
        The CSS also get a bit of help from <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bulma-switch-control" target="_blank">Bulma Switch Control</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons" target="_blank">Google material icons</a> and <a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons" target="_blank">Font Awesome icons</a><br/>
        It also have a small <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet" target="_blank">ASP.Net</a> backend for parts that are a bit more complex<br>
        For the JavaScript, here are the libraries used:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/esbuild" target="_blank">esbuild</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/leaflet" target="_blank">Leaflet</a></li>

    <div class="button container question" id="more-sketch">... sketches</div>
    <div class="container is-hidden answer" id="answer-more-sketch">
        What you see at first is just the """screensaver""" but if you click the power button at the bottom right, the real project will load!<br>
        <br>
        Sketches are a collection of small coding projects I made<br>
        Most of them are now separate modules, made to be easily taken by others projects, more information on that in the <a href="https://github.com/Xwilarg/Sketch" target="_blank">GitHub of the project</a><br/>
        Their original goal were to find a way to showcase cool things I did, trying to accentuate algorithm without relying too much on external assets (since I'm not super good at drawing and/or VFX)
        <br>
        The buttons at the bottom of the display can be used to switch between projects

    <div class="button container question" id="more-gamejam">... gamejams</div>
    <div class="container is-hidden answer" id="answer-more-gamejam">
        Gamejams are events where you need to make a game given a duration and a set of constraints<br>
        Constraints are usually a theme but they can also be technical constraints (make a game for gameboy), thematic constraints (make a game given a theme) or anything else!
        <br/>
        Some gamejams can be directly be launched on an embedded player in this website by clicking the play button under them

    <div class="button container question" id="more-lifeline">... lifelines</div>
    <div class="container is-hidden answer" id="answer-more-lifeline">
        Lifeline is a way to connect this website to someone else<br>
        There are 2 kinds of lifelines, dynamic and static<br>
        <br>
        <a href="https://github.com/Xwilarg/Lifeline" target="_blank">Dynamic lifeline</a> actually ensure a connection between two websites<br>
        When you press the "pull lines" button, it actually contact the other website and update the ID both here and there, ensuring that both websites are in communication<br>
        If you go to the other website, the ID there will be the same as displayed here!<br>
        <br>
        Dynamics lifelines however require the target user to have a website that can have a PHP backend, so statics lifelines are here where it's not the case!<br>
        They simply function by both users having a unique ID, once you enter the other user ID in the verification box, it validate that the two values combined give the expected result<br>
        This is simply done by combining the ID then computing a hash, comparing it to the expected value
