            Gamejams are challenges where you need to make a game in a limited amount of time given a certain theme<br/>
            This usually mean teaming up with others people and producing everything during that time<br/>
            <br/>
            And of course as all rules, they tend to be broken, some gamejams are 1 hour while some others are 3 month-long, some have no theme while some have many, some gamejam ask you to work alone or around some additional specific constraints, etc...<br/>
            <br/>
            Gamejams are numerous but feel free to check my account on the two main ones, the <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/users/zirk" target="_blank">Global Game Jam</a> and the <a href="https://ldjam.com/users/xwilarg/games" target="_blank">Ludum Dare</a>
