            Welcome to lifeline, a way to link some of the amazing people that do things with me<br/>
            <br/>
            And now, here is a bit of technical yapping on what this thing is:<br/>
            Lifeline are a way to link two websites, the ID shown are shared between them<br/>
            To verify the link, just press the Update button at the bottom and all link should update along the way<br/>
            <br/>
            However some lifelines are said to be "static" when the person doesn't have a website to receive it<br/>
            The verification button on their right allow them to use their personal ID to verify the link
