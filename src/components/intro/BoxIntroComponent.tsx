export default function BoxIntroComponent() {
    return <div className="container box">
        <p className="mark">Introduction</p>
        <div id="intro">
            Welcome at the boxes!<br/>
            Those represents differents objectives I'm trying to achieve<br/>
            Boxes that are empty means they weren't reached yet, but hopefully it'll come with time<br/>
            <br/>
            Obviously this isn't a finished list, some boxes might changes, some goals won't be shown there, etc...
        </div>
    </div>
